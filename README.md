# Not-Elon
Not hotdog but for Elon Musk

## why

You often see magificient images of Elon(gated) Musk(rat) and it can be difficult to determine whether an image is really him with all his gloriousness

To solve that, I created [Not-Elon](https://github.com/yevbar/Not-Elon)

## how to use

```bash
$ node app.js <location>
```

location can be either a filepath or a url (if url, it will need `http://` or `https://` in the url)
